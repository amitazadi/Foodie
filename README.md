### Description

- **`./src/components/`**: Dashboard reusable UI components. Each component should ideally be self-contained and not directly connected to the app's state.

- **`./src/component/Redux/store.js`**: Manages state management using Redux. `actions/` contains action creators, `reducers/` holds reducer functions, and `store.js` sets up the Redux store.

- **`./src/img/`**: This directory contains static assets such as images and global styles that are used throughout the project.

- **`./src/utils/`**: Stores utility functions, helper classes, or modules that are used across different parts of the application.

- **`./App.js`**: The root component of the application where routing and main layout components are often defined.

- **`./index.js`**: The entry point of the application where React is initialized and the root component is rendered.

This structure ensures a separation of concerns and makes it easier to locate and update different parts of the application. It also allows for better code organization, easier collaboration, and smoother debugging.


## Technologies Used

**ReactJs:** The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes state management with Redux for efficient data handling and updates.

**Redux:** To manage and organize the application's state in a predictable and centralized manner, making it easier to develop and maintain complex applications.

**Bootstrap:** Styling is done with CSS, and Bootstrap. Leveraging modern design principles to create a visually appealing and responsive dashboard.
